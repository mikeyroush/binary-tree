# binary-tree

This project implements a binary search tree data structure. The purpose of this is to provide a more efficient average search cost than that of other data structures such as linked lists. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

A working command line

### Installing and Running

Download the zip then link the files in the command line via the makefile and run the executable

Navigate to the correct directory and utilize the makefile

```console
foo@bar:~$ cd /path/to/directory/here
foo@bar:~$ make all
```

This will have created a few .o files and an executable. To run it, do as follows...

```console
foo@bar:~$ ./Main
```

Demo

```console
8[1]
4[2] 12[2]
2[3] 6[3] 10[3] 14[3]
1[4] 3[4] 5[4] 7[4] 9[4] 11[4] 13[4] 15[4]
Average search cost: 3.26667
```
